This repository demonstrates a common but obscure bug encountered when building Android apps with Expo CLI. The issue stems from problems during the `jetifier` transformation process, which is crucial for handling third-party libraries in Android projects.  The `bug.js` file shows a simplified example that might trigger the error (though the exact cause can vary significantly). The solution in `bugSolution.js` provides strategies to mitigate and debug this kind of failure.
