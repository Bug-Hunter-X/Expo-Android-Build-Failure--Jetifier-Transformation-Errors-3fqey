Several approaches can help resolve jetifier-related build errors. First, ensure you are using the latest versions of Expo CLI and related packages. Run `expo upgrade` to update. If the issue persists, try cleaning the project's cache: `expo prebuild --clean`.  In some cases, the problem might stem from conflicts between specific libraries. Carefully examine the error messages for clues and try updating or removing potentially problematic packages one by one. Consider explicitly specifying the versions of packages in your `package.json` to ensure consistency and avoid accidental updates that might introduce conflicts. As a last resort, you might need to try a fresh clone of your project and perform a clean build to eliminate any local environment-specific issues.
